# 💌 Kind Words - Social Affirmation Platform

**A simplified, focused .NET MAUI app for anonymous kindness sharing**

---

## 🌟 **What is Kind Words?**

Kind Words is a **clean, purposeful social affirmation platform** inspired by the indie game "Kind Words". It allows users to:

- **Send** affirmations, support requests, or gratitude messages anonymously
- **Receive** random messages from others to respond to with kindness
- **Reply** with encouraging words to help someone's journey
- **Connect** through a community of anonymous support and positivity

---

## 🎯 **Why This Project Exists**

This project was created as a **simplified alternative** to the original complex "Affirm8" project that suffered from:

- **22+ Syncfusion dependency errors** causing build failures
- **Bloated e-commerce features** (Product, Cart, Pricing) that were off-topic
- **247-line Product model** with unnecessary complexity
- **7+ confusing screens** with unclear purpose
- **Heavy third-party dependencies** creating maintenance nightmares

**Kind Words solves these problems** with a clean, focused approach that meets all school requirements while being maintainable and purposeful.
